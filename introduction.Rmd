# Introduction

Wetlands are one of the most important, yet most threatened and least protected ecosystem locally and globally (Skowno 2019). Wetlands refer to areas where water covers the land, for example, marshes, river deltas, edges of lakes, etc. The benefits wetlands produce to their surrounding communities are vast. These benefits include flood control, storm buffering and water quality improvement (Clarkson, Ausseil, and Gerbeaux 2013).

It is now well known that wetlands serve an important purpose within our communities. However, since the 1970s, wetlands in South Africa have been degraded due to bad agricultural practices (Working for Wetlands 2019). As a result, 35-60% of South Africa’s wetlands have been severely damaged or destroyed (Working for Wetlands 2019). 

Degraded or destroyed ecosystems lead to the loss of biodiversity. According to WWF’s 2018 living planet report, there has been a 60% global decrease in biodiversity of mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians (Grooten and Almond 2018). There have been many efforts to quell the global loss of biodiversity. One of the more noticeable efforts are the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (Convention on Biological Diversity 2020). The Aichi Convention presented a plan made up of five goals and 20 targets. Goal C focuses on biodiversity and states: “To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity.” (Convention on Biological Diversity 2020).

As a response to goal C, the Living Planet Index (LPI) was created as a metric to track the change in biodiversity over time (Loh et al., 2005). With regards to ecosystem health, biodiversity is imperative. Loss of biodiversity leads to reduced ecosystem resilience (Ritchie and Roser 2021). Thus, the conservation of ecosystems such as wetlands and the conservation of biodiversity go hand-in-hand. 

Given the importance of wetlands and the importance of the conservation of biodiversity, this study is placed on an important intersection between the two. This study forms part of a larger project called The South Africa BiodIveRsity Data pIpelinE for wetlands and waterbirds (BIRDIE) https://www.sanbi.org/biodiversity/building-knowledge/biodiversity-monitoring-assessment/freshwater-programme-birdie-project. The aim of the BIRDIE project is to collect and collate all types of waterbird data, analyse it, and make the outputs available to the public, either for wetland management use or recreational use. 

In this study the focus is on one of the main datasets used by BIRDIE called the Coordinated Waterbirds Count (CWAC) dataset. The CWAC dataset comprises approximately 200 different waterbird species across approximately 400 different wetland locations in South Africa. The CWAC project is conducted by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) and contains bird counts going as far back as 1970. 

Besides the CWAC dataset providing us with valuable historic bird count data in South African wetlands, it also allows us to use the birds as bioindicators. In this study bioindicators refer to biological aspects of an ecosystem that reflect changes in said ecosystem. According to Gregory et al. (2003), effective bioindicators are quantitative, easy to collect, simple to interpret and reflect specific changes in an ecosystem. Bird counts fit these criteria well. By understanding the fluctuations of bird counts over time and the biodiversity of bird species over time we have some insight into the state of the wetland over time. For example, it was discovered that the abundance of Podiceps cristatus (Great Crested Grebe) increased at the Mar Menor lagoon as eutrophication levels increased (Amat and Green 2010). In another example, in Southern Spain, it was found that the change in abundance of Fulica cristata (Red-Knobbed Coots) could possibly indicate soil siltation levels. Increases in the levels of siltation in the soil led to a decrease in abundance of Red-Knobbed Coots in the Southern Spain region during the 20th century (Amat and Green 2010). 

The CWAC dataset allows us to view such bird abundance trends over time, both for individual bird species and combined bird species for a given wetland. One of the most popular, and most effective, methods to model bird count time series is state space time series models (SSMs) (Auger-Méthé et al. 2021). SSMs are able to model time series data in a way that separates observation error from process error (Auger-Méthé et al. 2021). An SSM is a hierarchical model that models two different time series. One being for the state process (hidden or latent process), which is the unobserved time series that represents the underlying population dynamics. The other time series that is modelled is the observation process which refers to the observed counts of the state process. The benefit of separating the state process from the, often error prone observation process, is to allow a more accurate estimation of the true population (Kéry and Schaub 2011). Figure 1 gives an illustration of how the SSM separates the state process and observation process.
