Navigate to the master branch and download the files stored in the master branch. Run the initial_run.rmd file to build the pdf.

To generate the data used by the .Rmd files: Navigate into the R folder, run the barberspanData.R script line by line. A folder called data should be generated and in it should be a .RData file called Barberspan_counts.RData. Once this is generated the Rmd files should run with no problems (given that you successfully download all the packages that are required).
